    "- What the system guarantees  \n",
    "- What it explicitly does not attempt  \n",
    "- What evidence must exist for a run to be considered valid  \n",

    "Execution flow:\n",

    "Pipeline → Notebook → Runner (from `azure_batch_code.zip`) → ADLS\n",
    "\n",
    "The runner performs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strict schema read\n",
    "2. Fail-fast input contract validation\n",
    "3. Minimal declared transforms\n",
    "4. Deterministic metric computation\n",
    "5. Run-scoped publication\n",
    "6. Single run log creation\n",

    "## Scope\n",

    "### In Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full batch recompute of a finite historical dataset\n",
    "- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2\n",
    "- Synapse Spark execution\n",
    "- Run isolation using `run_id`\n",
    "- Exactly six published metrics\n",
    "- Single structured run log as evidence\n",

    "## Core Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Contract-First Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Input must satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact schema (no missing or extra columns)\n",
    "- Required non-null fields\n",
    "- Duplicate key rejection\n",
    "- Score consistency rule\n",
    "- Basic domain sanity\n",
    "\n",
    "Any violation causes immediate failure.\n",

    "No silent fixes.\n",
    "No coercion.\n",
    "No enrichment.\n",

    "### 2. Deterministic Batch\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same input file, the system produces identical metric content.\n",

    "### 5. Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly six metrics are produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- M1 — Games played per team per season  \n",
    "- M2 — Win / loss / tie counts per team per season  \n",
    "- M3 — Points for and against per team per season  \n",
    "- M4 — Total games per season  \n",
    "- M5 — Regular vs playoff game counts per season  \n",
    "- M6 — Neutral-venue game count per season  \n",

    "If any step fails:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The run status is recorded as `failed`\n",
    "- Metric outputs for that run are deleted\n",
